## 🐻 What is Pawsome Mary?

Developing with Laravel should feel like a walk in the woods—refreshing, powerful, and natural. **Pawsome Mary** is a curated starter kit designed by **BearnyCodes** to bridge the gap between raw functionality and high-end developer experience.

By combining the strength of **Laravel** with the elegance of **MaryUI** and the cutting-edge speed of **Tailwind CSS 4**, this kit provides a "bear-bones" foundation that isn't empty, but expertly structured.

### Why you'll love it:
* **Pawsome DX:** Pre-configured layouts that stay out of your way.
* **Grizzly Performance:** Optimized for the latest PHP 8.3+ and Livewire versions.
* **Modern Styling:** Harnessing the full power of Tailwind 4's CSS-first engine.
* **Bearny-Standard:** Opinionated where it matters, flexible where you need it.
